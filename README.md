 ## Workflow Docs

 This repo uses a Github Action workflow to automatically deploy the site. Using the custom _peaceiris_ github action, Hugo is first initialized, and then compiled. Then the Hugo command is run to generate the static outputs, which are pushed to the gh-pages branch, where they are deployed to Github Pages.
